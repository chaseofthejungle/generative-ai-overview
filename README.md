* **Calculus:** Allows AI models to 'learn'. Relies on *gradient descent*, or algorithmically informing the model how to modify/fine-tune parameters to reduce errors. The integration of calculus prevents AI models from making purely random guesses, instead measuring rates of change (*derivatives*).
  + Partial derivatives are stored as one vector (*gradient*). Values are fine-tuned as the AI 'learns'.
* **Linear Algebra:** Handles data structures (e.g, matrices, vectors) and represents weights/inputs for neural networks.
  + Each row of a set of data is represented as a matrix or a vector. For example, one point of data (e.g., employee's salary, SSN) can be represented as a vector.
    - When multiple employees in this example are grouped/stacked together, this forms a matrix.
* **Probability and Bayesian Statistics:** Assists AI models with handling uncertain (entropic) outcomes. Predictions are generated by calculating likelihood based on available data.
  + *Bayes' theorem* empowers AI models to modify conclusions in light of new data.
